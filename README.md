# MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter

<!-- [DOXYGEN MAIN] -->

The MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter serves as a bridge between the CUDA-Q programming interface and the Munich
Quantum Software Stack (MQSS). It enables seamless integration by providing two primary access
points: the Munich Quantum Portal (MQP), a cloud-based interface for remote quantum job submission,
and a high-performance computing (HPC) access point for users working on local or institutional HPC
resources. This module allows developers to write quantum-classical hybrid programs using CUDA-Q
while leveraging MQSS infrastructure for optimization, execution and quantum devices management.

## FAQ

<!-- [DOXYGEN FAQ] -->

### What is MQSS?

**MQSS** stands for _Munich Quantum Software Stack_, which is a project of the _Munich Quantum
Valley (MQV)_ initiative and is jointly developed by the _Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ)_ and
the Chairs for _Design Automation (CDA)_, and for _Computer Architecture and Parallel Systems
(CAPS)_ at TUM. It provides a comprehensive compilation and runtime infrastructure for on-premise
and remote quantum devices, support for modern compilation and optimization techniques, and enables
both current and future high-level abstractions for quantum programming. This stack is designed to
be capable of deployment in a variety of scenarios via flexible configuration options, including
stand-alone scenarios for individual systems, cloud access to a variety of devices as well as tight
integration into HPC environments supporting quantum acceleration. Within the MQV, a concrete
instance of the MQSS is deployed at the LRZ for the MQV, serving as a single access point to all of
its quantum devices via multiple compatible access paths, including a web portal, command line
access via web credentials as well as the option for hybrid access with tight integration with LRZ's
HPC systems. It facilitates the connection between end-users and quantum computing platforms by its
integration within HPC infrastructures, such as those found at the LRZ.

### What is the MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter?

<div align="center">
    <img src="./docs/_static/MQSS-Client-and-router.png" width="80%">
</div>

The MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter is a middleware module designed to bridge the CUDA-Q programming interface
with the Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS). Its purpose is to enable users who develop quantum
applications using the CUDA-Q API—whether in C++ or Python—to transparently execute their quantum
kernels on MQSS-supported backends.

As shown in the diagram, the user's code interfaces with the CUDA-Q API, which manages either local
simulation or remote execution. The MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter fits into this remote execution path through
two main access points:

- **HPC Execution:** The quantum job is routed from RemoteRESTQPU to the HPC node, then through an
  Executor and a RabbitMQ Client, finally reaching the MQSS HPC Adapter. This path is tailored for
  users running from high-performance computing environments and ensures compatibility with MQSS job
  management infrastructure.

- **Cloud Access Path via Munich Quantum Portal (MQP)**: Alternatively, users may access MQSS
  services through the Munich Quantum Portal (MQP). Jobs are sent via the same core logic,
  eventually reaching the MQSS MQP Adapter, which handles cloud-based dispatching of quantum
  workloads to target hardware or simulators supported by MQSS.

Together, these adapters abstract away the complexity of targeting specific hardware or services,
allowing CUDA-Q users to compile, submit, and retrieve quantum results through the MQSS. The MQSS
CUDA-Q Adapter ensures smooth interoperability and helps integrate CUDA-Q's compiler infrastructure
with MQSS's distributed quantum computing ecosystem.

### Where is the code?

The code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub:

### Under which license is the **MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter** released?

The MQSS CUDA-Q Adapter is released under the Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions. See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/MQSS-CUDAQ-Adapter/blob/develop/LICENSE)
for more information. Any contribution to the project is assumed to be under the same license.
